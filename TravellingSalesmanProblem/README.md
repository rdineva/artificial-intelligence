# Travelling Salesman Problem

## Problem
Solve the Travelling Salesman Problem using a Genetic Algorithm.

## Solution 
The program generates N randomly generated coordinates. 
The algorithm searches for the shortest route that visits each city exactly once.

Solved using a genetic algorithm with multi point crossover.

### Input
* N - number of coordinates, or cities (N <= 100)

### Output
On 5 lines print the fitness score of the best individual of the current generation. For generation number:
* 1st line - 10th generation
* 2nd, 3rd, and 4th lines - randomly selected generations
* 5th - the last generation
